The goal of this linear programming problem is to figure out the best weekly diet plan that costs as little as possible.
I have choosing how many units of five different foods to eat over a weekâ€”Shrimp, Broccoli, Chicken Breast, Salmon, and Dumplings. 
Each food comes with its own cost per unit, nutritional values for things like energy, protein, and vitamins, and we've set some rules based on what our body needs in a week.
We want to spend the least amount of money while making sure we get enough of each nutrient our body needs every week. 
These nutrients include things like energy (calories), protein, and minerals like calcium and iron. There's also a limit on how much sodium we can have, to make sure we're not eating too much salt.
We're treating this like a puzzle, where we can only buy whole units of each food (so no half a chicken breast, for example), and we're trying to fit all these pieces together in the best way. 
Our aim is to solve this puzzle in such a way that we get a shopping list of exactly how many of each food item to buy for the whole week that keeps us healthy and doesn't break the bank.

The constraints for this linear programming problem, should consider seven components of nutrition and their daily values, as shown in the following table:

Component Max/Min Daily Amount and measure

Sodium Maximum 5,000 milligrams (mg)

Energy Minimum 2,000 Calories (kilocalories, kcal)

Protein Minimum 50 grams (g)

Vitamin D Minimum 20 micrograms (mcg)

Calcium Minimum 1,300 milligrams (mg)

Iron Minimum 18 milligrams (mg)

Potassium Minimum 4,700 milligrams (mg)

Set this up as a standard linear programming problem with decision variables taking any non-negative values. In other words, partial servings are permitted.  

For nutritional constraints, consider setting these to satisfy a weekly diet. That is, multiply each daily requirement by seven (7).
